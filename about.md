Someone who likes learning and trying new things. Loves a good challenge and has the tendency to opt for the harder path just for kicks.

(I might be a masochist for opting to take CS3216, but I don't go for physical pain - cue long distance runs =P. Yep I don't do running, but cycling is fine - it's how I try convince myself that I'm not getting too unfit =P)
