Someone who likes learning and trying new things. Loves a good challenge and has the tendency to opt for the harder path just for kicks.

(I might be a masochist for opting to take CS3216, but I don't go for physical pain - cue long distance runs =P. Yep I don't do running, but cycling is fine - it's how I try convince myself that I'm not getting too unfit =P)

My interests include computing (obviously), math, science and music. I love a good discussion about almost anything under the sun. I love singing, yup I was in choir. As a kid, I never had formal music lessons but I hope to be able to master at least one instrument some point in my life (I currently do play the guitar, but my abilities here are far from satisfactory =/)
