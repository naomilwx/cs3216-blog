Customary first post. Yeah boring title but I'm too sleepy to care...

Using Jekyll over github pages because - hey, it's convenient, a few minutes and done! One irritation: the need to manually set the date and title the post files, but I'll fix it when I'm less sleepy. And should get around to mucking around and styling this properly too.

[This is really just a filler, and will probably disappear once I get around to writing a post proper.]
